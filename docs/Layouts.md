# Layouts

## Principles
### Predictable
- Use intuitive and predictable layouts with consistent UI regions and spatial organization.
### Consistent
- Layouts should use grids, keylines, and padding consistently.
### Responsive
- Layouts are adaptive. They react to input from users, devices, and screen elements.

## Layout structure
- Regions in a layout are foundation for user interactivity
- A large screen layout has three main regions:
  1. App bars
  2. Navigation
  3. Body

- Helps to set minimum and maximum dimensions for the body and margins
- Setting for scaling behavior as well allowing each region to adapt

## Body region
- Mainly for displaying majority of the content
- Uses scaling values for three parameters
   - Vertical and horizontal dimensions
   - Number of columns
   - Margins

## Navigation region
- The navigation region holds navigational components and elements such as the navigation drawer or navigation rail
- It helps users navigate between destinations in an app or to access important actions

## Composition
- Itâ€™s important to arrange components and internal elements in a way that preserves visual and functional relationships between elements across all screen sizes.

## Visual grouping
- Elements in a layout that have similar content or functionality can be grouped together and separated from other elements using open space, typography, and dividers.
